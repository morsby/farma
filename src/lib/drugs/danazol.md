Danazol exhibits hypoestrogenic, hyperandrogenic effects that cause atrophy of
the endometrium, which can alleviate the symptoms of endometriosis.[4]

Danazol prevents ovulation by suppressing the increase of luteinizing hormone
during the middle of the menstrual cycle.[5][6] Danazol inhibits ovarian
steroidogenesis resulting in decreased secretion of estradiol and may increase
androgens. Danazol displaces testosterone from sex hormone-binding globulin
(SHBG), displacing it and increasing serum testosterone levels.[5] Danazol also
directly stimulates androgen and progesterone receptors.[5]

Pituitary hormones are largely unaffected, although luteinizing hormone may be
slightly elevated.[7]
